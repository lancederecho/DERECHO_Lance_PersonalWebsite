                    Become so Rich: I really aspire to become so rich, that I can do whatever I want to make me and the people around me
                    so happy that, for a moment, we would stop worrying about life's burdens. I believe that money will act as a fuel
                    to run my dreams. I think everybody has an ambition to become wealthy, but not everyone admits it, maybe because 
                    society teaches us to live simple; thus, shrinking our ambitions.
