                    Finishing highschool: It is one of my achievements. I believe that it is true because this is the 
                    time when almost all of us learns to depend on himself and learns some hints on the path
                    that one may choose to live with.

                    Tennis Championship: Winning in sports championships is certainly a great achivement. It showcases 
                    one's physical and intellectual capacities, and also it reflects one's hard work and discipline. 
                    I can always remember those hard trainings and hard lessons.

                    a huge passion for it. Not only do I have passion for it, but I also have an enormous interest in it.

                    Winning Band Contests: Learning to play a musical instrument, especially hearing your own sound when
                    playing an alto saxophone is a very heart-warming and soul-refreshing experience. Winning a contest

                    Reading Lots of Books: Some years ago, I set a goal to read one book every month. I skipped a lot of months
                    but still ended reading lots of books and learned lots of things from the books that I read. It takes 
                    a lot discipline and self-control to read a book ,so because of that reason, I can consider it a great 
                    achievement on my part. Not just finishing lots of books, but learning a lot of things.

                    First Steps on Learning Visual Arts: Being able to draw, to paint, etc. has my goal some years ago.
                    And taking steps onto your goal is considered an achievement. Adding little by little achievements, 
                    you will reach your desired goal. So this is a big step and a big achievement for me.
